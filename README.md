# About Us
We are changing the way grassroots cricket (the second most popular sport) is played in the world. SCORE-GO started as a simple scorekeeping website for grassroots cricketers to keep their scores. A 10x better way to do it compared to existing alternatives. Gradually it became a network, recognising cricketers for their talent and making them better with performance analytics. The big idea is to connect every stakeholder (businesses and professionals) of cricket with each other and capture all transactions happening on the network.<br/>
SCORE-GO is a cutting-edge cricket scoring website that revolutionizes the way cricket enthusiasts engage with the sport. This platform offers users the convenience of recording cricket scores online, assembling teams virtually, and accessing in-depth insights and summaries of every match played. With its user-friendly interface, SCORE-GO simplifies the task of scoring, making it easy for both players and spectators to stay involved. The website's innovative features not only enhance the efficiency of scorekeeping but also enable users to analyze match data in real-time, providing valuable insights into player performance, team dynamics, and game trends. By digitizing the scoring process and centralizing match records, SCORE-GO redefines the cricket experience, making it more interactive, organized, and informative for cricket aficionados of all levels.<br/>
